JUSTIFICATION FOR PROJECT

With the ever-growing need for data acquisition in many fields employing data collection and analysis for the various systems, there is a need to come up with a data logging system that is minimal in terms of footprint but also efficient in terms of data collection 
over a long period of time with minimal supervision and easy download of the data by the user for analysis and presentation

WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?
This project describes the design and implementation of a general data logger system that is able to collect data from multiple input channels and to store the same in a personal computer or external storage.

Arduino Mega microcontroller is used as the primary controller. The Arduino processes all the sensory data from the sensors (temperature sensor, humidity sensor, and Light sensor) 
and provides appropriate control signals to store the data to an external device for analysis. 
A prototype pc based data logger is then developed and tested to verify the concept mentioned

How to Test 
Once configured, the dta logger was able to record data onto a micro SD card which was in a (.txt) format file that can easily be imported to and analyzed by Microsoft Excel software for clear visualization of the variation in sensor parameters.
